# Spatio-Temporal Gait Characterization from Wrist-Worn IMUs

## Project Overview

This repository contains the final report for our project on gait characterization using wrist-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs), conducted as part of our work at the Columbia University Data Science Institute in collaboration with Johnson & Johnson.

Due to data confidentiality, we cannot share code or datasets publicly. However, our final report is available in this repository as a PDF document, summarizing our methodology, findings, and contributions.

### About the Project

This study investigates the feasibility of using wrist-worn IMUs for spatio-temporal gait analysis, a crucial metric for mobility assessment in healthcare. While lower-back sensors are the gold standard for gait analysis, they are impractical for daily wear. Our research explores machine learning and signal processing techniques to extract gait parameters from wrist sensor data.

### Key Components of the Project

- Data Processing & Handling: Efficient methods to process large-scale IMU time-series data.
- Self-Supervised Learning: Leveraging lower-back sensor data as ground truth for training gait detection models.
- Machine Learning Models: Developing and evaluating classifiers to distinguish between walking and non-walking movements.
- Gait Feature Extraction: Estimating cadence and other gait characteristics from wrist IMU data.
- Clinical Relevance: Investigating the potential of wrist sensors for remote patient monitoring and mobility assessments.
